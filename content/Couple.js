    <h5>This is the Beginning</h5>
    <p className="big">
      Cheston and James met at the insistence of a mutual friend in
      May&nbsp;of&nbsp;2013.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hit it off on their first date, chatting and drinking until the
      restaurant closed. In their first evening together, they discovered a
      shared taste in music, as well as in the peculiar work of David Lynch.
      Serendipitously, Cheston came into a pair of tickets to a performance by
      Chrysta Bell, Lynch&apos;s muse, just one day later, making for a special
      second date.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell for one another as they spent time exploring the beautiful Bay
      Area. Their first trip out of the city was to a secluded village in the
      mountains atop Santa Cruz, and they quickly branched out beyond
      California, visiting Seattle, Vancouver, and Hawaii within their first
      year. In June 2014, they moved together to the Mission District of San
      Francisco, along with James&apos;s two cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      One year later in late 2015, Cheston found himself with an unexpected
      offer to join the campaign of Hillary Clinton, which was headquartered in
      New York City. Cheston was excited about the opportunity to serve on a
      campaign and James was excited about the prospect of living in New York,
      so they packed up the cats and set off to Brooklyn. What followed over the
      next year was a journey they could&apos;ve only imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was over, they took a month to decompress by traveling across
      Asia. They encountered cat cafes and national protests in Korea, ate their
      way across Japan, survived a weeklong offroad motorcycle tour of Vietnam,
      relaxed on the beaches in Thailand, and spent a day at Disneyland Hong
      Kong to cap it off.

    <h5>Of the Rest of Their Lives</h5>
    <p className="big">
      Even before they left for New York, Cheston knew he wanted to propose to
      James.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, joining a presidential campaign didn&apos;t seem like the right
      time for such a major life event, so he waited. That didn&apos;t mean that
      Cheston didn&apos;t already have it all planned out: brunch at their
      favorite tearoom, a hike up Twin Peaks to the spot where he first told
      James that he loved him, and finally back down the hill to a surprise
      party with all their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan seemed fool-proof, especially given the yearslong drought in
      Northern California. Of course that meant that when the big day came, it
      was pouring rain. So, after brunch and a lot of goading that &quot;yes, in
      fact, we do have to go on a hike <em>right now</em>,&quot; the two made
      their way to the summit during a brief pause in the rain. Cheston proposed
      and (surprise!) James said yes, and with fairytale precision, it began
      pouring rain again. Nevertheless, they managed to get off the mountain and
      down to an overwhelming celebration with their dear friends and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      What remains now is a chance to solemnize and celebrate their commitment
      with, you, the people who have loved and supported them throughout this
      journey. They cannot wait to welcome you to New York for their wedding
      this December of 2018.
