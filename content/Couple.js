    <h5>This is the Beginning</h5>
    <p className="big">
      Cheston and James were introduced through a mutual friend and met at St
      Vincent wine bar on May 8th of 2013. They hit it off right away &mdash;
      drinking and talking until the restaurant closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serendipitously Cheston received a free pair of tickets to a performance
      by Christa Bell(of Twin Peaks fame) the day afterwards which turned into a
      sudden second date. From there James and Cheston quickly fell in love and
      grew together, travelling to the Santa Cruz mountains, Seattle, Vancouver
      and Hawaii in their first year. After a year together they moved into an
      apartment in San Francisco’s Mission district with the two cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they had some adventures, explored the city, grew their careers and
      friend groups. Falling more in love along the way. Cheston had the
      opportunity to join the Hillary Clinton campaign in mid-2015 which drew
      him to New York. Thankfully, James was game to join him and embark on
      another journey that they could have only imagined. After a long year and
      a half of hard work in New York they took off and travelled across Asia.
      Cat cafes and national protests in Korea, eating everything in sight
      across Japan, a motorcycle tour of Vietnam, relaxing on the beach in
      Thailand and spending a day at Disneyland in Hong Kong to cap it off.

    <h5>Of the Rest of Their Lives</h5>
    <p className="big">
      Even before they left for New York, Cheston knew he wanted to propose but
      getting engaged right before spending a year on a presidential campaign
      didn’t seem like the best time to plan a major life event. But

      Even before they left for New York, Cheston knew he wanted to propose but
      getting engaged right before spending a year on a presidential campaign
      didn’t seem like the best time to plan a major life event. But Cheston was
      certain where he wanted to propose, Sutro Tower at the top of Twin Peaks
      in San Francisco; the spot where they first declared their love for each
      other and a frequent hiking destination in the city for the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had it all planned out, Cheston. Easter Brunch at our favorite tea
      spot, hike up Twin Peaks, propose and head back into town for a surprise
      party with all of our friends. It was brilliant, if they author doesn’t
      say so himself, alas in the years spent in California there was a drought
      but no longer. Day of, it was pouring. So after brunch and a lot of
      goading, that yes in fact we did have to do this right now; the two made
      the hike after the rain had abated. Cheston proposed and he said
      yes(otherwise you’d be reading a very different story right now). Promptly
      atop the mountain it started pouring, they managed to get off the mountain
      and celebrated with friends and family.
