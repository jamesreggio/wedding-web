      take Amtrak to Albany or Saratoga. Read on for more details.

    <h5>By train</h5>
    <p>
      Amtrak operates frequent train service throughout the Northeast to both
      Albany and Saratoga Springs. Amtrak trains are clean and spacious, and
      almost always on-time &mdash; plus there&apos;s no traffic or security to
      deal with. It&apos;s our preferred way to get to Saratoga.

    </p>
    <p>

      takes approximately three hours and costs between $45 and $80 each way.{' '}

      For guests traveling <strong>from points south of New York City</strong>,
      search from your point of origin to either Saratoga Springs (SAR) or
      Albany-Rensselaer (ALB). You will see options to connect in Penn Station,
      and your fare will be lower than two separate tickets.

      For guests traveling <strong>from Massachusetts</strong>, there is one
      train daily to Albany-Rensselaer (ALB) between Boston&apos;s South Station

      travel and costs between $25 and $80 each way.
    </p>

      If you decide to fly to New York City and take the train north, consider
      flying into Newark (EWR) or Kennedy (JFK). Both of these airports have
      speedy public transit options that can get you directly to Penn Station.
